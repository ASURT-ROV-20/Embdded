ROV Monitoring System

one of the problems faced us last years that there could be hardware faults in the system which are impossible to be detected such a(as the ROV is running under water and can't be opened 
to mesure voltage/current readings) such as :
	- noise in the escs signals
	- fault in motors leads to more current than calculated
	- pi Temp. which leads it to restart

what we did:
	we made a data logging and live monitoring system to watch all the voltage,current of all power signals and pwm of the escs 
	
How this system is working
	Logging System
	when the rov is powered up the logging system starts reading 
		- current consumed by the thrusters 
		- chobbers voltage levels
		- escs pwm 
		and logs this data with a time stamp to a log file in sd card
	
	Monitoring System
	the logging/monitoring system connects to a server by an ethernet port (independant to the pi ethernet) and sends the reading from the logging system to the server and on the
	server there is a GUI used to visualize this data into graphs
	
Why both logging/monitoring 
	it's intended to use the monitoring system by HW team to watch the rov power readings to detect if the is a fault about to happen so we can predict the faults and fix them before
	happening and the logging system will be used as a documentation to trace back the system over time
	
How we did this
	we used esp32 as our controller, ads1115 ADC, current sensors, enc28j60 ethernet module, SDCard module
	
Example of the logs generated by the system:
